# psaux

A "particle" simulator hobby project (more like planets).

Entities experience (currently) infinite n-body gravity and scatter mostly elastically.

Uses simplistic graphics coming with pyglet as OpenGL wrapper. Will fix later.

There are some utility scripts for debugging.

## Prereqs

- Python>=3.8

## Features

- Press and hold down mouse 1 to spawn new planets, the drag length defines their initial velocity
- Hold shift and press mouse 1 to move the "Sun"
- Scroll left and right to modify time
- Press and hold mouse 2 to move the screen
